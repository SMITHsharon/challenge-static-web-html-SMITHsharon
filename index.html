	<article>
		<p>I was born and raised in Oklahoma City and moved to middle Tennessee in my early 20s. When I was 28 I left my job with Hospital Corporation of America and became a full-time student at Vanderbilt University, ten years out of high school. I earned a double major in computer science and mathematics, and through the following decade worked out of a home office as a free-lance technical writer and enjoyed the luxury of being a stay-at-home mom. I currently teach mathematics at Martin Luther King Academic Magnet High School.</p>

		<p>When I’m not teaching or grading papers (which is all the time), I’m involved with my church, and I enjoy reading, movies, live performances of all kinds, socializing with friends. I am very excited about downsizing, living simply, and living in community, close to and involved with my neighbors. </p>
