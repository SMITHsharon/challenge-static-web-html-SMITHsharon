			<h3>Brief Bio</h3>
			<p>Born and raised in Oklahoma City, I've now lived in middle Tennessee long enough to consider myself a native Nashvillian. I left a job with Hospital Corporation of America to became a full-time student at Vanderbilt University (ten years out of high school) where I earned a double major in computer science and mathematics. In subsequent years I worked out of a home office as a free-lance technical writer, and followed that with a decade of teaching mathematics (and a side venture at AP Computer Science) at Martin Luther King Academic Magnet High School.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m one of the founding members of Germantown Commons, the first cohousing community in Tennessee. I was involved in planning the site design and ongoing work to bring the vision to life. Together we became our own development company (LLC), developed and tracked a budget, obtained a $5,000,000 construction loan to build the 25 condos and common house, and marketed the properties for sale. I currently serve as the Treasurer of our HOA.</p>

			<p>I try to live intentionally and am reinventing my whole self, career-wise, once again.</p>
